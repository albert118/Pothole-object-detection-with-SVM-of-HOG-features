# Image Processing and Pattern Recognition (2022 Group 27)

2022 Spring Session UTS Image Processing Project Repository. 

# Project Description

Aimm: develop a pothole object detection system.

The main function of this project is to automatically detect cracks on the road. 

This project can be used in road maintenance to greatly improve the efficiency of finding cracks. 

Similarly, this technology can also be used in future autonomous driving to improve the safety of future traffic.

# Guides

## Using GitHub

## Set Up Python Environment for Development

Using Python verison 3.9.+ to 3.10.0, set up the environment like so.

Create and source your choice of virtual environment, eg. [venv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). I also recommend the [win wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/) if you're on Windows. Activate it, then install the dependencies with pip like so,

```
// once in your development environ
pip install -r requirements
```
